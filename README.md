# QrTransfer

Transfer files across devices using only QR codes. Needs no internet connection, cables, or anything. Just a screen and a camera.

The transfer rate is around 5kB/s, which makes it only useful for small text files and images.

## What it can do

Transfer files from one device to another without internet or cables. Save the transferred file to your documents.

## How to use

Works on mobile devices and in a browser. Select between Receive and Transmit modes. 

When transmitting, make sure the QR code is large enough on the screen.

When receiving, make sure the camera has a good view of the QR codes. You will see a small progress bar on the top of the screen moving along, it slows down towards to end and might seem finished even though its not.

## Installing

Currently the project uses Expo. Install the Expo-CLI and run ```npm install``` in the project to install.

## Current State

This was a quickly made project and I do not intend on updating it further. The core functionality is completed, although the design may need to be change to make it more intuitive and visually appealing.
